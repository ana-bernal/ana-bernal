### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ana ðŸ§™

Here you'll find some of my projects.

- ðŸ“’ The repository [data-projects-notebooks](https://github.com/ana-bernal/data-projects-notebooks) contains several notebooks for projects I made while learning to explore data and do predictions with machine learning models and other tools in Python. 

- ðŸ§® I also have some works on mathematics (algebraic combinatorics). More details about this works can be found in [my website](https://ana-bernal.github.io/projects.html).
